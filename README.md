This a UI Automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with Java, TestNG and Maven that automate the below mentioned use cases:
1) Register and login 
2) Check the listed Categories has Items 
3) Add random item to the cart 
4) Remove item from cart 
5) Complete successful checkout with random item

I have used a POM design pattern for automation the test cases so we can update any of them sepratelly and can run them sepratelly too.
