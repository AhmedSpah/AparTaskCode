This a UI Automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with Java, TestNG and Maven that automate the below mentioned use cases: 
1) Register and login 
2) Check the listed Categories has Items 
3) Add random item to the cart 
4) Remove item from cart 
5) Complete successful checkout with random item

I have used a POM design pattern for automation the test cases so we can update any of them without need to update thw whole test cases.
All test cases can be run from the file Tests.java in the SRC folder
